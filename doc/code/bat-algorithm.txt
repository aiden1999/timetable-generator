Define the objective function f(x)
Generate initial population of the bat X = {x1, ..., xn}
For each bat xi in X
    Initialise the pulse rate ri, velocity vi and loudness Ai
    Define the pulse frequency fi
While termination criterion not reached
    For each bat xi in X
        Generate new solutions using equations (1.1), (1.2) and (1.3)
        Generate a random number rand
        If rand > ri
            Select one solution among the best one
            Generate a a local solution around one of the best
        If (rand < Ai) and (f(xi) < f(x*))
            Accept the new solution
            Increase ri and reduce f(xi)
Ranks the bats and obtain the current best bat
