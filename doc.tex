\section{The Timetabling Problem}
The timetabling problem is a constraint satisfying problem and it is known to
be NP-Complete. The aim is to create a university timetable where several
constraints are met. These constraints are either hard constraints or soft
constraints. For a solution to be valid, all the hard constraints must be met.
Not all (or in fact, any) of the soft constraints need to be met for the
solution to be valid, however it is preferable for as many soft constraints to
be met as possible. Examples of possible hard constraints include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item At most only one session (i.e., a lecture or lab) is happening in a specific
          room in a specific period
    \item A student can only be attending at most one session in a specific period
    \item A teacher (e.g., a lecturer or lab helper) can only be attending at most one
          session in a specific period
    \item The size of a student group cannot exceed the capacity of the room
    \item The room must be appropriate for the type of session, e.g., a lecture must be
          in a lecture theatre, and a lab session must be in a computer lab
    \item Part time teachers can only be assigned certain time slots, e.g., they may not
          work on Tuesdays, so sessions they teach cannot be scheduled for time slots on
          Tuesday
\end{itemize}
Possible soft constraints include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Students do not have more than two consecutive hours scheduled
    \item The capacity of a room is well suited to the size of the student group, to make
          an efficient use of space e.g., a group of twenty students are not going to be
          in a room with a capacity of two hundred
    \item If a student or teacher has one session immediately after another, then the
          respective rooms are relatively close to each other
\end{itemize}
A solution is invalid if at least of one the hard constraints are met. For example, if a student is scheduled to be in two different sessions at the same time - this is known as a clash.
\section{Methods}
\subsection{Genetic Algorithms}
Genetic algorithms (GAs) made up a group of search metaheuristics, inspired by
Darwin's theory of evolution. Here, the fittest members of a population survive
and produce offspring, which inherit the characteristics of the parents. It is
also possible for the offspring to have small mutations within their genetic
code, which may or may not be beneficial towards the population's survival.
This theory can be applied to search problems. In this case, the population
represents the search space, which is a collection of candidate solutions to a
problem, and the population of solutions evolves as the algorithm searches for
a desired solution.

There does not exist a rigorous definition of GAs, but most methods use these
five phases:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initial population - populations of chromosomes
    \item Fitness function
    \item Selection - according to fitness
    \item Crossover - to produce new offspring
    \item Mutation - random mutation of new offspring
\end{enumerate}

The initial \textbf{population} is a set of \textbf{individuals}, where each
individual represents a candidate solution to the problem. These solutions will
almost definitely not satisfy the problem, as they are randomly generated, but
that does not matter.

An individual (and hence that candidate solution), is defined by its
\textbf{chromosome}. The chromosome is often encoded as a string of binary
characters; however, any alphabet can be used. These characters are called
\textbf{alleles}, and a single character or group of adjacent characters that
encode a particular element of the candidate solution are known as a
\textbf{gene}.

Using the example of the university timetabling problem, several alleles may be
used to encode a room, but together they are one gene.

The \textbf{fitness} function measures how well a candidate solution solves the
problem. For example, in the instance of the university timetabling problem,
the fitness of the solution could be measured by the number of times in the
solution that a hard constraint is not met. This means that a solution with a
score of 0 is a valid solution, as there are instances of a hard constraint not
being met.

Once the fitness function has been used to calculate the fitness of each
individual, the fittest individuals are chosen for reproduction in the
\textbf{selection} phase. There are several ways to select individuals to use
for producing offspring. One way is to simply choose the two individuals with
the best fitness. Another way is to use roulette-wheel sampling, where any
individual could be chosen for producing offspring, but fitter individuals are
more likely to be chosen. This second method introduces more variation into the
offspring, to reduce the chance of convergence onto a local maximum.

The \textbf{crossover} phase, or reproduction phase, is where genetic material
is exchanged between two parents. The crossover operator randomly chooses a
locus (position) in a chromosome, in between alleles. The subsequent before and
after parts of the chromosome are swapped between the two parents to produce
two offspring. This is repeated multiple times to produce a population of the
same size as the initial population. Whether this is by two parents reproducing
multiple times using different loci or not, depends on the method used in the
selection phase.

After reproduction, \textbf{mutations} can be introduced into the offspring. For example, if the chromosomes are encoded by binary strings, then some bits are randomly flipped. However, there is a very small chance of this occurring at each bit, a suggested probability is 0.1\%. By introducing mutations into the offspring, the likelihood of reaching a local maximum is reduced.

Once there is a new population made up of the offspring, the process repeats until a solution is found. Each repetition is called a \textbf{generation}, and the entire set of generations is known as a \textbf{run}.
